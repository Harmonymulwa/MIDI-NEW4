Arpligner is a **multi-track** & **polyphonic** arpeggiator which will use your
own arpeggiation patterns. It comes as VST3 & LV2 MIDI plugins and as a standalone application.

- **Multi-track**: Multiple arpeggiation patterns can play at the same time for
  a given chord, each one in its own track of your DAW, or on its own MIDI
  channel,
- **Polyphonic**: Each step can play several notes of a chord at the same
  time. "Steps" can also hold over an arbitrary length of time and overlap.  So
  besides arpeggiation _per se_, you can do strumming or really any kind of
  "turning a plain block chord into something more interesting".

To achieve this, Arpligner does very intentionally _**not** come with its own
graphical interface for editing patterns_. Instead you will feed it arpeggiation patterns
as regular (and possibly live) MIDI data. You can thus
make use of your DAW piano rool and MIDI sequencing capabilities, play those
patterns live, or use an external MIDI sequencer (software or hardware).

Therefore, you can use it as a regular arp, playing your chords against
pre-written patterns, or the opposite. Or both can be live data! That would be
having two keyboard players: one in charge of the chords and the other one in
charge of how to layout those chords.
